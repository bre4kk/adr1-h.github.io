# About Me
Hello my name is Adrian I am from Spain and I am currently working as a Pentester/Red Team in a company.

I started my journey in the world of cybersecurity at the end of 2022 and in this time I have acquired certificates such as the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) and I have a couple in my sights such as the CRTO (Red Team Operator) and the CRTL (Red Team Lead) of Zero Point Security.

I will use this blog to post interesting information that I can't find on the Internet. If you like the content you can follow me on my socials and if you feel extra generous you can leave me a tip on Buy Me a Coffee which I will be very grateful for.

Cheers.
